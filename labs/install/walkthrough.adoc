= Lab 0 - Workshop Introduction - Environment setup

Learn how to set up your environment and tools available for this workshop.

Welcome to the Kafka Zero to Hero Workshop! It's a pleasure to guide you on this hands-on experience.

This workshop aims to offer you practical experience with Red Hat AMQ Streams, that is the productized and supported version of https://strimzi.io[Strimzi.io]. It is not meant to be a complete training of AMQ Streams. For this purpose we have amazing courses here https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training-and-certification[training and certification], covering many aspects of Red Hat AMQ Streams in depth.

The main objective is to cover as many Kafka aspects during this workshop.

== Setup CodeReady Workspaces

These walkthroughs use link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces, window="_blank"] (based on https://www.eclipse.org/che[Eclipse Che]).
It's an IDE on the cloud based on containers. You can also use a local development environment if you'd prefer (i.e. https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code], https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Studio] (formerly known as JBoss Developer Studio), https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA], etc).

There are several projects into the workspace that we will be using during the labs.

Open the IDE link:{codeready-url}/dashboard[CodeReady Workspaces, window="_blank"]

Credentials:

* Username: `{user-username}`
* Password: `{user-password}`

On the opened page, click on the workspace as showed in the picture:

{empty} +

During the import some questions will appear in the right bottom corner, just confirm all questions.

When the setup is ready (be patient it can take some minutes), you should see a screen like this:

{empty} +

Now that you successfully started your workspace, take some time exploring the project structure using the `left menu`.

=== Running the project

On the right menu, click on the cube icon. Under the tools menu, click on `run app locally`. You should see the application build starting and then application running.

As this is a web application, we are going to explore it in future labs, CodeReady Workspaces will suggest to you to open a link. Click on  `yes` and then `Open Link`.

In the end you should see a web app on the side menu, and a `hello router` message in the logs.

To stop the application use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
